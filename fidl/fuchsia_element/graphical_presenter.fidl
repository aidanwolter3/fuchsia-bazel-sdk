/// The `GraphicalPresenter` protocol is typically implemented by a session component or
/// its child that presents element views.
///
/// The presented views can be annotated with `fuchsia.element.Annotations` to communicate
/// presentation properties to the `GraphicalPresenter`.

    /// Presents the view described by `view_spec`.
    ///
    /// ## ViewController
    ///
    /// `view_controller` allows clients to receive a `ViewController` for the
    /// presented view. The client can use the `ViewController` to control the view's
    /// presentation and receive events.
    ///
    /// If `view_controller` is closed, the client can assume that the view is
    /// no longer being presented, and will not be presented in the future.

    /// If the client closes the `view_controller`, or does not provide a request
    /// to `PresentView`, the view may be dismissed at any time with no signal to the client.

    /// as the annotations for the element. For example, if the `GraphicalPresenter`
    /// component uses `ElementManager` to add an element to the session, and gives it
    /// an annotation, the presenter can expect that annotation to be passed back in
    /// `ViewSpec.annotations` for the associated view.

/// that was presented.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// The client must keep `ViewController` connected to ensure the view is
/// presented. Once `ViewController` is closed, the view will be
/// permanently dismissed.
///
/// For example, if the view originates from an element, the component
/// that manages the element's lifecycle may choose to stop the element's
/// component once the `ViewController` is closed.
///
/// ## Epitaph
///
/// This protocol is closed with an epitaph:
///
/// * `ZX_OK` when the view is dismissed
protocol ViewController {
    // Provides control over the view's `annotations`.
    //
    // The presenter must observe incoming annotation requests and update
    // the presentation accordingly.

    // When calls to methods that update annotations return, clients can assume
    // that the annotations have been incorporated into the presentation.

    /// Instructs the presenter to dismiss the associated view.
    ///
    /// This call results in the `ViewController` being closed with a
    /// `ZX_OK` epitaph once any exit animation has been performed, the
    /// view/view holder connection has been severed, and the component
    /// instance serving the view can be terminated.
